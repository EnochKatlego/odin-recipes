<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Milk Tart, is a beloved South African dessert known for its creamy custard filling and delicate pastry crust. Lightly flavored with cinnamon, it’s a perfect combination of sweet, smooth, and comforting. Traditionally served at tea time or as a dessert, Milk Tart can be enjoyed warm or chilled. The custard is made primarily from milk, sugar, and eggs, giving it a soft and silky texture that melts in your mouth.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>1 pre-made pie crust (or homemade pastry)</li>
 <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

 <li>1 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
 <li>Ground cinnamon for topping</li>

 <h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
<li>Line a pie dish with the pastry crust, trim the edges, and bake it blind for 10 minutes to set the base.</li>
<li>In a saucepan, heat the milk and butter until just before boiling.</li>
<li>In a bowl, mix the sugar, flour, cornstarch, and eggs until smooth.</li>
<li>Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to avoid curdling.</li>
<li>Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat until it thickens into a custard consistency.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla essence.</li>
<li>Pour the custard into the prepared pie crust.</li>
